# tutoR

Contains all of the resources for [Edge by Ascential's](https://www.ascentialedge.com/) lunch and learn R program.

<br>

The material will cover the set of packages in R known as the [*tidyverse*](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and will follow many of the examples from the [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) book.

The idea for this course is to give an introduction to R. No prior coding experience is assumed. Following the material will hopefully enable anyone to leverage R to create visualisations, manipulate data and create reproducible reports.
