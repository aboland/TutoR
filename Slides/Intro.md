R & RStudio
-----------

-   [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a free software environment
    -   Originally R was developed for statistical computing and graphics.
    -   Now R is also used to create dynamic documents, presentaions and dashboards.

<br>

-   [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is a GUI which makes it easier to edit R scripts and display visualisations.

<br>

-   Download both R and RStudio.

R Script
--------

-   Download the R script [intro.R](https://github.com/aboland/learnR/blob/master/Rcode/intro.R)
-   Double click on the file and it should open in RStudio, continue there!

Tidyverse
---------

-   We will cover the set of packages know as the *tidyverse* <https://www.tidyverse.org/>.
-   These pacakges contain many useful functions for cleaning, manipulating and visualising data.

<br>

-   A very useful resource is the [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) book which is available for free online.
-   This book covers many of the tidyverse packages and we will look at examples from this book.
